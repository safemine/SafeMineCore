Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/SafeMine-Qt (on Mac) or
safemined/safemine-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

When upgrading from a version prior to 0.0.1.0, the
first startup of SafeMine Core will run a migration process which can take a few
minutes to finish. After the migration, a downgrade to an older version is only
possible with a reindex (or reindex-chainstate).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.0.1.0

Downgrading to a version older than 1.0.0.0 is no longer supported due to
changes in the "evodb" database format. If you need to use an older version,
you must either reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

### Downgrade of masternodes to < 0.0.1.0

Starting with the 0.0.1.0 release, masternodes verify the protocol version of other
masternodes. This results in PoSe punishment/banning for outdated masternodes,
so downgrading even prior to the activation of the introduced hard-fork changes
is not recommended.

Notable changes
===============

This release adds some missing translations and help strings. It also fixes
a couple of build issues and a rare crash on some linux systems. Also included are hotfixes for upcoming developmental requirements and expansions.
