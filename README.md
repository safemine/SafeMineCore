# SafeMineCore

### What is SafeMine?

SafeMine is built with miners as the core component that keeps the chain secure and will allow users to build dapps and NFTS on top. We plan to allow both CPU, GPU and ASIC mining on our chain without moving to energy heavy ASIC resistant algorithms.

We also have masternode support and our end goal is moving towards a carbon neutral blockchain.
